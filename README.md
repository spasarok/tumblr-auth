# TumblrAuth

A Python package for making authenticated Tumblr requests. This is very much experimental and not at all complete :)

### To Do
* Fix oauth session sequence to store user oauth session on backend (is there a way to do this without storing oauth sessions in memory?)
* Change front end to use a framework
* Create service classes
